This is my new green field emacs.d.  I was an emacs user way back in
'99 but got away from it.  When I triumphantly returned last year I
forked [1] technomancy's emacs start kit [2].  Over time I added my own
customizations as well as support for a bunch more languages and other
random things.  This served me pretty well for a while but it got to
the point where there were a lot of little issues like slow startup,
conflicts, etc.  So... here I am, starting fresh.
