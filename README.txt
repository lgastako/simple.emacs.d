Note this is has been replaced by the emacs directory in my dotfiles project.
Not that anyone cares, but now you know, and knowing is half the battle.

This is my new green field emacs.d.  I was an emacs user way back in
'99 but got away from it.  When I triumphantly returned last year I
forked [1] technomancy's emacs start kit [2].  Over time I added my own
customizations as well as support for a bunch more languages and other
random things.  This served me pretty well for a while but it got to
the point where there were a lot of little issues like slow startup,
conflicts, etc.  So... here I am, starting fresh.
